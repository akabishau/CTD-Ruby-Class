# README -- Code The Dream Backend Periodical

This repository contains the framework for the application called "periodical" in the following Treehouse video for Active Record Associations in Rails: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/has-many-through-associations .  You should create a git branch called periodical and make your changes there.
When you are done with the application, because you have completed all the changes from the Treehouse videos, you can git add, commit, and push your changes and
make a pull request.

The first thing you will have to do is to complete the setup.  This is described in the Teacher's Notes at the link above.  You do not do the rails new command,
as that has been done for you.  You start with the rails g model Subscriber command as described in the notes and complete the directions in those notes and in the
video.
